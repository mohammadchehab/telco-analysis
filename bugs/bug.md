There is bug 

1 - on the @http://127.0.0.1:5173/vendor-analysisÂ  while the api returns results the vendors dont go to the filter box even tho they are not null and therefor the list UI goes empty so its a UI bug

2 - the list capability should not show anything that is not completed similar to the reports page it must be the same

3 - finally enhancement persist the UI until i click clear using localStorage.
