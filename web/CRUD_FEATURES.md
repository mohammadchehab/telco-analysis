- **Update**: Click the edit (pen) icon on any capability card to modify details
- **Delete**: Click the delete (trash) icon to remove capabilities with confirmation

### ✅ Inline Editing
- **Modal Forms**: Clean, focused forms for create/edit operations

- **Status Management**: Update capability status (Domain Analysis, Review Required, Ready for Research, Completed)
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected in the UI

### ✅ Domain & Attribute Management
- **Quick Access**: "Manage" buttons on each capability card for domains and attributes
- **Direct Navigation**: Click to go to domain/attribute management for that capability
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear relationship between capabilities → domains → attributes

### ✅ User Experience

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **React Hooks**: useState for form management and modal states
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design with modals, forms, and buttons
- **API Integration**: Direct calls to backend CRUD endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user notifications
- **State Management**: Redux for global state, local state for forms

### Backend Integration
- **RESTful API**: Full CRUD operations via HTTP methods
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Database Operations**: SQLite with proper foreign key constraints
- **Error Responses**: Consistent API response format

## Benefits

1. **No Separate Interface**: CRUD operations are integrated where users expect them
2. **Familiar UX**: Uses standard patterns (edit icons, modals, confirmations)
3. **Efficient Workflow**: Quick access to all management functions
4. **Consistent Design**: Matches existing application styling
5. **Scalable**: Easy to extend with additional features

## Future Enhancements

- Bulk operations for multiple capabilities
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Import/export functionality
- Audit trail for changes
- Role-based permissions
